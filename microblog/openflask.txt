# flask basics
to open flask, you first need to build it by installing python and the python3 virtual environment:
* sudo apt install python3
* sudo apt install python3.12-venv
then build the venv:
* python3 -m venv venv
after that you can activate the venv:
* source venv/bin/activate
you can exit the venv by doing:
* deactivate
to stop the current app you have flask set to, you press CTRL + C in the shell.
to open the app you activated when you do flask run, you ctrl click on the link in the shell.
