# welcome to my github pages !
### Welcome to my portfolio! This is my ongoing project that I am going to be maintaining throughout my career, and I will add more projects later on as I extend my skillset. 
This readme will contain a list of commits and changes to the project and later when I add to the portfolio, a description for each project and what skills I learned from doing them.
